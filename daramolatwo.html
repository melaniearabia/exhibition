			<h1>Daramola's Class: World History Project 2</h1>
		</header>
		<p>In project 2, named A Timely Solution, we studied the Industrial Revolution. My group and I focused on the invention of cement. To sum and show our research, we created a 3D sketch of the machine, an actual model, and a presentation of the making and importance of the invention.</p>

				<p>After discovering the origins of cement and than process, we drew out a 3D image of the machine. The original image is on the left and the drawing is in the center, along with an actual image of cement on the right. The 3D image includes some notes and labels to help the viewer underst5and the different compartments.

				<p>Our 3D model was sectioned off to the group members to construct. The middle image is the full product of out Portland Cement Machine. The product we made was made of cardboard, bottles, tape, and other materials. The actual machine was made of calcium compounds, silica, alumina, and iron oxide.</p>
