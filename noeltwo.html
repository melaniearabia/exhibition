		<p>In project 2, named A Timely Solution, our objective was to research two topics; one being about child labor and the other was social media and gender. We designed an art piece/collage, poem, and an artist's statement about the topics.</p>

				<p>In the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, child labor came into play. To learn more, we were given an image showing child labor and we had to create a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hJCYK5S5g40ZylIoFu3N2OYiJS9CSb-7Eygdrlr5qo/edit?usp=sharing">poem</a>, art, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19w7xWwLaHhrKeuauOtRDSpVOlSZ8NxQzgwrExWFDRhw/edit?usp=sharing">artist's statement</a> to potray the photo. My image, shown on the left, is a group of kid workers in a group. I made a poem from the  perspective of one child being mad at the photographer for not helping and only taking pictures. My art peice was the work force raining down on the kids, washing their innocence away.</p>

				<p>Social media and gender is a topic that I decided to research because I wanted to find out if gender was a big factor in social media. An article talked about men and women that were democrats and republicans who posted on Facebook about sexual misconduct. I wrote a poem, did an art peice, and wrote an artist's statement based of my poem and art about the topic. My art, shown in the center, shows a black and white drawing of a shaken girl with a survivor blinfold on her, while being surrounded by politics and social media.</p>
